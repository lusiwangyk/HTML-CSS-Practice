    <div class="introduction">
        <p>International Cat Care is a charity foundedin 1958 by a small group of very passionate cat lovers, who were compelled to do something about the dismal lack of information about cat health and welfare. Over 60 years later, we are still working hard to improve the health and wellbeing of all cats everywhere, working towards a world where each cat's life experience will be as good as it can be.</p>
        <p>Our aim is to enable and inspire people to understand cats' individual needs and perspective, and to act in the interests of each cat's welfare. We do this by creating and sharing knowledge, insights, skills and current best practice to people can feel confident in their ability to help cats and to challenge ignorance and misconceptions. Our activities are rational and realistic, underpinned by evdience and experience, always balancing what is tired and tested with an appetite for new ideas.</p>
